# Purpose
This website was created to help you sleep better. It takes into account how long it takes the average human to fall asleep and then tells you when to wake up based on REM sleep cycles. We used HTML and CSS to create the animations that went into the background stars and the rotating moon. The time-based calculations were made using JavaScript. Check out our website at http://paulinakhew.me/powernapp/ and happy sleeping! ðŸ˜´ðŸ’¤

## Hackathon
This project was created at Brickhack, a 24-hour hackathon hosted by the Rochester Institute of Technology on February 16-17, 2019. Check out their [website](https://brickhack.io/). 

## Design
The background was created using CSS animations. Below is a static preview. The stars in the background twinkle and the moon rotates slowly over the course of two minutes. Click the link to Power Napp to see it in action!
