A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/paulinakhew/pen/jdQKYr.

## Purpose
This website was created to help you sleep better. It takes into account how long it takes the average human to fall asleep and then tells you when to wake up based on REM sleep cycles. We used HTML and CSS to create the animations that went into the background stars and the rotating moon. The time-based calculations were made using JavaScript. Check out our website:

Happy sleeping! ðŸ˜´ðŸ’¤
